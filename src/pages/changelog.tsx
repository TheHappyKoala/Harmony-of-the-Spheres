                  Added planetary atmospheres, which are very much a work in
                  progress, in addition to a couple of new exoplanet scenarios.

                  New high resolution textures have been added for all the
                  planets of the solar system, Earth's moon, the Galilean moons
                  and the dwarf planets Eris and Makemake. Since these textures
                  take much longer to load, a loading screen has been added, as
                  well. Moreover, light now decays according to the
                  inverse-square law and its colour depends on which part of the
                  spectrum most of a star's light is emitted.{" "}

                  The preceding update added a bug that caused the simulation to
                  crash when you tried to add a mass to a simulation with no

                <p className="contributor-description">
                  Six exoplanet scenarios have been added, one of which
                  simulates a system with a grand total of three confirmed
                  planets. Some stellar mass templates have been added, and more
                  than that, it is now possible to choose not to use a mass
                  template and specify the mass and radius of the mass you are
                  adding yourself. Feedback on this feature would be much
                  welcome, and yes, textures will be added in a future release
                  for these custom masses!{" "}
